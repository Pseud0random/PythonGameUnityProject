# PythonGameUnityProject
Initial project template for the python learning game.

1. Done so far:
- Made a basic unity template to design basic components and test stuff.
- Drone can navigate towards player.
- Player can collide with walls.

2. Pushing updates in git GUI (IMPORTANT):
- Open the repositroy in Git GUI (i woulden't compress when prompted because idk if that will wreck the unity project).
- If the update is to be made to a specific branch press branch (at the top), checkout, then the branch to be updated. 
- Click "stange changed". 
- Click "commit".
- give a description of what has been done in the commit message and then click "push".
