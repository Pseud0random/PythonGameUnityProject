# PythonGameUnityProject
Initial project template for the python learning game.

So far:
- Made a basic unity template to design character controllers and lighting techniques

Notes:
1. Drone
- When guide drone is folowing, set as a child/base movement off of character
- When drone is doing anything else, make it its own independant object

2. Connecting Unity project to github
